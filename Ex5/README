1) Instructions:
Run each of the following executables with:
/usr/bin/python adaboost.py --section [#section_num]

Each script corresponds to the relevant question.
Each #section_num should represent the corresponding section (e.g: a=1, b=2, etc).

-- IMPORTANT NOTE: Some routines output both a saved figure and a displayed plot (using matplotlib's imshow).
If you're using remote control on Nova, make sure your connection supports the channeling of gui windows to the host machine,
otherwise the script might appear "stuck" until the figure window is closed.

2) The other auxilary files required are:
  - hw5.py

  All files are as supplied with the Exercise without modification, and present in the directory.


3) Plots are saved within the same folder. The following plots & charts are included and attached to the printed doc as well:
